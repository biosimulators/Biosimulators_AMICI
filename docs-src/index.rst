BioSimulators-AMICI documentation
=====================================

BioSimulators-AMICI provides a `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interface to the `AMICI <https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI>`_ biological simulation tool. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use AMICI to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more models (in `SBML format <http://sbml.org>`_).

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by AMICI is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/amici>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using AMICI to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
